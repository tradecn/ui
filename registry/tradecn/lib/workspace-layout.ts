// What a workspace saves, and what it leaves out on purpose.
//
// A layout is the dock arrangement plus one small record per panel: its kind, its title, and the
// JSON the panel asked to keep, such as a symbol, a link group, or a view setting. It is meant to be
// reused: saved as a template, handed to a colleague, restored next quarter. That only works when
// nothing tied to a session is in it, so the boundaries travel in the payload and say, as data, what
// the writer put in and what it kept out.
//
// Storage is the consumer's. Nothing here touches localStorage. A stored layout comes back through
// `parseWorkspaceLayout`, which takes nothing on trust.
